            Welcome to the Banana Community movement. We are a counter-culture movement that preaches the
            philosophy of DIRT in
            contemporary society, seeking peace aesthetically and spiritually. We live in a globalized world that
            pretends
            to be
            beautiful, perfect, and lovely every day, when in reality, beneath the layers, there is immense rot among
            the
            elites
            who control the means of production. Just look at the social division in emerging countries; even in wealthy
            neighborhoods, you'll find traces of a miserable population struggling daily for a meager dignity.
            And what exactly is this website within the Banana Community movement?
            <div style="margin: 15px;"></div>
            This website is a form of protest against minimalism and what is considered beautiful on most websites
            today:
            extreme performance, standardized layouts. This website brings together everything that is bad and rotten,
            which
            is
            what society screams: meaningless pages, news that may be true, may be false, pages that are completely
            aesthetically ridiculous with no standards whatsoever.
            <div style="margin: 15px;"></div>
            And how do I become part of the community?
            <div style="margin: 15px;"></div>
            Basically, self-identify as part of the community and follow the philosophy, and you will be part of the
            community.
            We are inclusive of absolutely everyone, but if you see someone who identifies as part of the community
            committing
            acts that are outside the community's standards, refuse them entry, because we have simple rules that, if
            broken,
            make it pointless to be part of the movement.
            <div style="margin: 15px;"></div>
            What are the community rules?
            <div style="margin: 15px;"></div>
            Here we advocate freedom, your right as a human being to be who you are, to dress the way you want, and to
            exist
            the
            way you want, as long as it doesn't infringe on the freedom of others. Racism, homophobia, ableism,
            classism,
            and
            other prejudices do not define us as a community. Respect everyone. We are a movement that seeks peace and
            unity
            among all people: men, women, trans people, Black people, white people, Asian people, or whatever. We are
            all
            one,
            like bananas. On the outside they are yellow, but some have spots, some are bigger than others, some even
            seem
            to
            rot over time, but most of the time, inside it's the same thing: a banana.
            <div style="margin: 15px;"></div>
            Join the banana movement and change the world.
